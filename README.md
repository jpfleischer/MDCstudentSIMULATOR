# MDCstudentSIMULATOR

## Play this on replit! https://replit.com/@JacquesFleische/MDCstudentSIMULATOR


Greetings, digital citizen. You may have come across
this cringeworthy masterpiece for any number of reasons.

Perhaps you, too, are an MDC student. Consider yourself most luckyâ€”
for you enjoy the seldom-seen opportunity of being an MDC student
twice. Once in real life, and once more within this game.

There are almost two weeks left in the semester. What will you do?
Will you get your stuff together and become a studious academic,
or will you party the nights away? That, my friend, is up to you.

Never forget to have fun.

### Developer Notes

The replit is known not to work on Google Chrome on Mac. This is likely
a site-wide issue. It is probably not an issue with this replit in
particular. Just try Safari. Mac is also known to not support the sound,
which is like half the experience. Just download the GitHub repo at that
point: <https://github.com/jpfleischer/MDCstudentSIMULATOR>

This game has been drastically downsized to 600x400 pixels resolution
to fit within the replit screen.
